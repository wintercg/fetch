# whatwg/fetch

This repository contains changes to the WHATWG Fetch standard to make it more suitable to server side runtimes.
These changes will soon be, or are in the process of being upstreamed to the [WHATWG fetch standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/).

This fork is no longer being worked on, and any further needs in that area are expected to be met by contributing to the upstream standard.
